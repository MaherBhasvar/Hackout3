Front end made with React and Redux. Backend is a Python server with Flask. API are built with web scrapping algorithm. CSS is built with Bootstrap.

The idea is Central Transport System, in which we can provide passengers point to point service, such if we want to go from DA-IICT, Gandhinagar to IIT Bombay, Mumbai, we just type in the location and date of travel, the app will then find the flights or buses and then send find Time Efficient and Cost Efficient Routes. The point is, in this we also integrate public and private transport system of cabs and buses within the city of travel. So the cab will pick the person up from the location such as DA-IICT, Gandhinagar to Ahmedabad Airport and then to Mumbai Airport through flight and from Mumbai Airport to IIT Bombay through cab service. 

The app currently has limited functionality, that provides Flight and Bus services through major cities. Packages are provided to end user on Time and Cost Efficient Basis, so user pays the amount lets say Rs 2000 and his/ her entire ticket from one location to another location is booked. And then he just needs to relax.



To start client server, cd client, then npm install, then npm run

To start backend, cd backend Server, then  python3 server.py runserver -d
For testing use testing.py
